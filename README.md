## SuperLife - VivaRisk Program Overview 
### Objectives
VivaRisk is implementing a purpose-driven approach in SuperLife's life insurance products through the following objectives:

>Encouraging healthy behaviors in policyholders.<br />
>Improving policyholder mortality rates.<br />
>Driving revenue growth through market expansion.<br />
>Boosting market presence and brand elevation.<br />
>Strengthening financial outlook by reducing claims frequency and severity.

### Program Design
Program Incentives: A comprehensive health incentive program focused on physical fitness, offering discounted gym memberships and educational workshops.<br />
Additional Incentives: Financial rewards for healthy behavior and social connection initiatives.<br />
Technology Integration: Mandatory use of a mobile app for mental and physical well-being monitoring.<br />

### Pricing and Cost
In pricing and cost analysis, using solely the Society of Actuaries (SOA) mortality rate may not accurately represent specific cohorts compared to Kaplan-Meier (KM) mortality rates. To address this, an adjusted mortality rate is introduced, and lapse rate is calculated using kaplan meier.<br />
Mortality Savings: Calculation of mortality savings by comparing pre- and post-intervention rates.<br />
Economic Value: Analysis of the expected present value of benefits and comparison between scenarios.

### Assumptions
Program Assumptions: Assumptions related to participation rates and interventions.<br />
Economic and Demographic Assumptions: Assumptions related to inflation, interest rates, and profit margins.

### Risk Management
Risk Identification and Ranking: Identification and assessment of economic, longevity, cyber security, financial, client behavioral, regulatory, and third-party risks.<br />
Mitigation Strategies: Strategies to mitigate each identified risk type.

### Conclusion
SuperLife's purpose-driven approach, bolstered by robust risk management, promises resilience and societal impact. By incentivizing healthy behaviors and integrating data-driven analysis, it navigates challenges adeptly. SuperLife's commitment to accuracy and societal well-being ensures sustainable growth and value for stakeholders in dynamic market environments.
